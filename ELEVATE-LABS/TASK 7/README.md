1. To view information about the extensions we have downloaded, we need to click on the three dots. From there, we will find the option for extensions.

2. We can check for any suspicious extensions that may be present.

3. If no suspicious extensions are found, we can review the details of each extension, including their permissions and other settings.

4. There are additional options available, such as site access, source, ID, inspect views, and more.

**Conclusion:**
- We have learned how to identify both suspicious and non-suspicious extensions.
