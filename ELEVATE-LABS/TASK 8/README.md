**--TASK 8--**  

**Objective:** Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and secure communication.  

**Requirements:** Any open-source VPN.  

**Summary:**

1. In this task, I used Kaspersky VPN. It is not open source, but it allows you to get 200MB of data daily.

2. After opening the VPN, we turned it on. It automatically selected the fastest server, which was in Singapore.

3. To verify that my IP address had changed, I visited the website whatismyipaddress.com, which confirmed that my location corresponds to Singapore.

4. Regarding network speed, according to speedtest.net, I experienced a download speed of 21.17 Mbps and an upload speed of 4.05 Mbps while the VPN was turned on. When it was turned off, I had a download speed of around 80 Mbps and an upload speed of 112 Mbps.

5. The traffic is encrypted, as websites utilize HTTPS, indicated by a padlock in the address bar.

6. Kaspersky VPN features:
   - Encryption: Utilizes AES-256 (military-grade)
   - Protocol: Uses the Hydra protocol (by Hotspot Shield)
   - Privacy: Claims to log no browsing activity, but offers limited transparency compared to more privacy-focused VPNs.

**Conclusion:**

**Benefits:**
- AES-256 encryption for secure traffic
- User-friendly interface, making it ideal for beginners
- Protecting Yourself When Using Public Wi-Fi Networks
- Backed by a reputable cybersecurity company

**Limitations:**
- Daily data cap: Only 200â€“300 MB per day (insufficient for streaming or large downloads)
- No option to select servers in the free version (auto-connect only)
