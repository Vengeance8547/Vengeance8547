-- TASK 5 -- 

Objective: Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types.
 
Tools: Wireshark (free).

Summary: 

1. Download Wireshark from its official website (https://www.wireshark.org/download.html).

2. Open Wireshark and select the network adapter you want to use for capturing packets.

3. After that, Wireshark will start recording all the traffic on the network.

4. To stop the packet capture, click the red button located at the top left corner.

5. Examine the packets. You can filter them by protocols such as HTTP, ICMP, DNS, and TLS.

6. Save your file. In the menu on the left, find the option labeled "Files." After clicking it, you will see two saving options: "Save" and "Save As." Select one and assign a name to the file, which will be saved in .pcap format.

7. Findings:
   - Discovered the procedure to launch Wireshark.
   - Learned how to apply filters to isolate specific packets.
   - Exported the file for additional analysis.
