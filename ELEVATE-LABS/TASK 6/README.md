**-- TASK 6 --** 

**Objective:** Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.

**Requirements:** Any online password checker.

**Summary:**

1. **A strong password should include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, symbols, and variations in length.**

2. For example, if I set the password to 'Password123':
   - The password contains uppercase letters.
   - The password contains lowercase letters.
   - The password includes numbers.
   - However, it lacks symbols.
   - Additionally, the numbers are in sequential order.
   - These factors contribute to making it a weak password.
   - The absence of symbols and the presence of sequential numbers are key issues.
   - The password received a score of 75% due to these shortcomings.

3. **Common Attacks:**
   - **Brute Force Attack:** In this type of attack, the attacker tries every possible combination to guess the password.
   - **Dictionary Attack:** Here, the attacker uses a precompiled list of passwords or usernames to find the correct one.
   - **Phishing:** This method involves tricking users into revealing their passwords.
   - **Rainbow Table Attack:** In this method, the attacker uses a precomputed list of hash values to crack passwords.
   - **Birthday Paradox:** This concept utilizes the probability of hash collisions to demonstrate that different inputs can produce the same hash value.

4. **Key Findings:**
   - Passwords are critical for authentication.
   - To create a strong password, it is essential to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, symbols, and variations in length.
