-- TASK 6 -- 

**Objective:** Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.

**Requirements:** Any password checker online.

**Summary:**

**1. A strong password should include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, symbols, and variations in length.**

**2. For example, if I set the password to 'Password123':**
- The password contains uppercase letters.
- The password contains lowercase letters.
- The password includes numbers.
- However, symbols are absent.
- Additionally, the numbers are in a sequential order.
- These factors contribute to making it a weak password.
- The lack of symbols and the presence of sequential numbers are key issues.
- The password received a score of 75% due to these shortcomings.

**3. Common attacks:**
- **Brute Force Attack:** In this type of attack, the attacker tries every possible combination to guess the password.
- **Dictionary Attack:** In this scenario, the attacker uses a precompiled list of passwords or usernames to find the correct one.
- **Phishing:** This method involves tricking users into revealing their passwords.
- **Rainbow Table Attack:** This is a method where the attacker uses a precomputed list of hash values to crack passwords.
- **Birthday Paradox**: Utilize the probability of hash collisions to demonstrate that different inputs can produce the same hash value.

**4. Key Findings:**
- Passwords are critical for authentication.
- To create a strong password, it is essential to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, symbols, and variations in length.
